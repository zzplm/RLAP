Machine Unlearning for Robust DNNs: Attribution-Guided
Partitioning and Neuron Pruning in Noisy Environments

We first conducted preliminary validation of our approach on MNIST because it runs relatively quickly, and you can use this for initial validation.
The experiments mentioned in the paper were conducted in the CIFAR10 and SpeechCommons folders.

The frameworks we used differed across datasets: we employed Torch for MNIST and CIFAR-10, and TensorFlow for SpeechCommons.

For hardware configuration, we utilized an A10 with 32GB cache, and we used Linux with a unified Conda environment.
